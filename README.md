In our project we have data collected regarding the user of internet from 1990 to 2016. We will be analyzing the internet user rate from 1990-2016. In this project we will try to discover the main reasons due to which the internet users grew over the years. We will also be checking out the main countries who developed in the past decade, and the main reasons for its development.
